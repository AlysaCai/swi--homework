Method of complements：
   In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number
from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical 
calculators and is still used in modern computers.

   The nines' complement of a number is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. 
To subtract a decimal number y (the subtrahend) from another number x (the minuend) two methods 
may be used:
   In the first method the nines' complement of x is added to y. Then the nines' complement of the 
result obtained is formed to produce the desired result.In the second method the nines' complement 
of y is added to x and one is added to the sum. The leading digit '1' of the result is then discarded.
Discarding the initial '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number
of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' 
complement plus one is known as the ten's complement.The method of complements can be extended to other
number bases (radices); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction, 
represent negative numbers in base 2 or binary arithmetic and test underflow and overflow in calculation.
Byte：
   The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing 
a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of 
text in a computer[1][2] and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many 
computer architectures.

Integer:
    In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range
of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to
contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits 
(bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different
types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to 
represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.
Floating point:
    Floating Point is an album by John McLaughlin, released in 2008 through the record label Abstract Logix. 
The album reached number fourteen on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart.
